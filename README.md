# Introduction

In this course we explore various approaches to computer vision challenges each with a Classical Geometric Computer Vision approach and it's Deep Learning counterpart.

# Projects

## 1. Shake My Boundary

Edge detection is one of the most important steps in CV. In this project we examine the various methods of Edge Detection on a number of pictures. Further, we also examine the combinations of these edge detection methods.

## 2. MyAutoPano

Field of Views determines the amount of pictorial data a camera captures at a given time. Sometimes, even with the largest fields of vies, one may still not have enough coverage of a given scene. The simplest way to counter this problem is to take multiple pictures with overlapping parts of the scene and then stitch them together; this is called Panorama. In this project we examine the classical method using corner detection and feature matching to generate beautiful Panoramas.

## 3. FaceSwap

Modern cinematography has made use of numerous advancements in the field of computer vision. FaceSwap has been one the most prominent ones (cue in Wiz Khalifa's - When I see you again, RIP Paul Walker you absolute Legend). In this project we examine multiple classical methods for performing faceswaps. Also, in the Deep Learning version we try to improve the accuracy by making minor changes to the pipeline by introducing parts like histogram equalization.

## 4. AutoCalib

For all it's marvelous abilities, CV would be nothing if the camera is not calibrated correctly. This projects emphasizes the need and the method to calibrate cameras.

## 5. Buildings built in minutes - An SfM Approach (Structure from Motion)

Stereo vision works similar to Panorama in the fact that it involves feature matching of overlapping parts of the sceme. Structure from Motion aims to use this principle to generate 3D views of a scene by utilizing multiple consecutive images. In this project we examine the classical approach to this method.

## 6. Learning SfM an unsupervised way

This project is the same as above except that we approach the problem with a Deep Learning solution.
